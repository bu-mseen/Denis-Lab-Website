Anna was a graduate student in Cell and Molecular Biology Program. She received her medical degree summa cum laude in 2003 from the Russian State Medical University in Moscow and a masterâ€™s degree from Rockefeller University in New York City in 2007. She has conducted important and diverse work on the functions of p53, the leptin receptor and energy metabolism. Her lab project involved the use of mouse models of Brd2 knockdown associated with obesity and protection from insulin resistance and Brd2 constitutive expression associated with B cell malignancy. Most recently she has investigated the role of signal transduction in the innate immune system, and the mechanisms behind how Brd2 deficiency can uncouple inflammatory signal transduction and transcription from insulin resistance in the context of obesity. Her work has been widely cited and published; she is currently a research specialist in the Flow Cytometry Core of Boston University Medical Center and actively collaborates with us on studies of obesity, and its associated metabolic disturbances, including cancers, in humans.
