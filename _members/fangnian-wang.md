Fangnian received his medical degree from Shihezi Medical College, Xinjiang, China and Ph.D. from Shanghai Medical University. He completed postdoctoral training with Dr. Mary R. Loeken of the Section on Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, at the Joslin Diabetes Center of Harvard Medical School, before he joined the lab as a postdoctoral fellow to study Brd2 phenotypes in mouse models. He was exceptionally talented in molecular cloning and the manipulation of murine embryonic stem cells, the construction of transgenic and knockout mice and the biochemistry of energy metabolism. He investigated the hypothesis that B cell-restricted knockdown of Brd2 function in mice leads to immune deficiency, and whole body-knockdown leads to disruptions of energy balance. He is now a staff scientist at IQuum Inc, in Marlborough, MA.
