Dr Andrieu is a French molecular biologist from Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, with a research interest in the signal transduction pathways that are relevant for obesity-associated inflammation, in particular, how the inflamed tumor microenvironment of insulin-resistant obesity exacerbates the dangerous properties of human breast cancer cells. These properties include invasion, proliferation, migration and other mechanisms of metastasis that are upregulated as tumor cells progress.
