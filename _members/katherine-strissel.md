 A cell biologist with a background in neural development and tissue remodeling having intensely studied the vertebrate eye, front and back, cornea   to retina, then changed directions almost entirely and examined adipose function and immune cell interactions in the context of obesity and    metabolic disease in mice and human cells.  Here now, examining inflammatory cytokine patterns that stratify obese metabolic phenotypes in    African American women to identify those with increased risk for breast cancer- with the hope that such inflammatory biomarkers could be utilized  clinically as an aid to prevent future disease. Current studies focus on the adipose-immune cell microenvironment to identify cellular mediators  responsible for inflammatory signals that could promote cancer progression in this high risk population and elsewhere.
