Paul joined the lab as a BU undergraduate and conducted his thesis work on the proteomics of B cell lymphoma in the lab. He completed his undergraduate degree at Boston University in 2006 in the prestigious University Professors Program and graduated magna cum laude in a field of his own design, “Proteomic Immunology”. He went on to become a medical student at Boston University School of Medicine. He has conducted independent research in our lab since 2004 and was the recipient of numerous scientific awards, including a Cancer Research Summer Student Award, Commonwealth Scholar Award, University Professors Program of Boston University – Best Thesis Award, and research studentship awards from Alpha Omega Alpha and the American Cancer Society. He presented his work at international meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research and at Keystone Conferences. He investigated the hypothesis that fundamental proteomic differences between lymphomic, mitogenically stimulated and resting B cells elucidate the mechanisms of lymphomagenesis and lymphoma progression. He was named to the highly prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute/NIH Scholar in Residence Program, and worked in the Staudt Lab on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, MD. He then returned to BUSM, completed his medical training, and is now a radiation oncology fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.
