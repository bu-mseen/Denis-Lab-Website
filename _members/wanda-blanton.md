Wanda received her undergraduate degree magna cum laude from Washington University, St. Louis, MO in 1997 and M.D. from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 2002. She was an intern and resident at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, from 2002 to 2005. She received several prestigious awards, including membership in the Golden Key honor society and Alpha Epsilon Delta honor society, the Sterling Merit Scholarship, University of Kansas School of Medicine, and she was a Sarnoff fellow at Washington University, St. Louis. Wanda was a GI fellow and postdoctoral trainee in the Immunology Training Program at BU School of Medicine. She tested the hypothesis that lentiviral vectors that overexpress Brd2 can expand the lymphoid lineage in mice, upon transduction of murine hematopoietic stem cells and the reintroduction of those cells into mice by stem cell transplant. That work was published online in December 2013 in J Leuk. Biol. These experiments deepen our understanding of human immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and lymphoid malignancy. Wanda is currently in private GI practice in the greater Boston area.
