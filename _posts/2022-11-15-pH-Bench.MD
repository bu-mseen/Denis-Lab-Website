With the help of BUMC Campus Planning & Operations, we were able to have a set of shelves installed over our pH bench. Now we are in the process of arranging the bench's final set up. First up are the essentials for any pH Bench: a scale, a stirplate, and a pH meter. While still very much a work in progress, the pH bench is now operational
