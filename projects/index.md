Risks for obesity and its inflammation-driven complications, including pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke, are not equally distributed among adults in US cities, nor are children equally at risk as they develop. There is substantial evidence that some components of cardiometabolic risk are transmitted through molecular mechanisms such as unresolved chronic inflammation; as well as social and family structures, the built environment, and disparities of health care access; each component of which can be modified by pervasive racism, socioeconomic inequality, stigma, social exclusion and other macro-level, sociological forces.
