Risks for obesity and its inflammation-driven complications, including pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke, are not equally distributed among adults in US cities, nor are children equally at risk as they develop. There is substantial evidence that some components of cardiometabolic risk are transmitted through molecular mechanisms such as unresolved chronic inflammation; as well as social and family structures, the built environment, and disparities of health care access; each component of which can be modified by pervasive racism, socioeconomic inequality, stigma, social exclusion and other macro-level, sociological forces.

Obesity is associated with increased risks for cancer of the breast, colon and several other organs. Whereas insulin-resistant obesity is recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, not all obesity is inflammatory; certain ‘metabolically healthy’ obese (MHO) adults preserve normal metabolism, are glucose tolerant and their fat is not inflamed. Several types of cancer can arise through chronic inflammation, leading us to wonder whether the low-inflammatory profile of MHO adults also protects against obesity-associated cancers. There are insufficient epidemiologic data that address the question of whether obesity and other metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance or dyslipidemia interact to promote long-term risk of obesity-associated cancers.

Using a targeted epigenetic approach, our lab has shown that it is possible to uncouple obesity from inflammation and diabetes. Our animal studies have produced severely obese mice that are metabolically healthy, have a reduced inflammatory profile and are protected from Type 2 diabetes (mice die of old age). This epigenetic approach involves a family of regulatory proteins called double bromodomain proteins (BET) that bind to acetylated lysines in histones and control gene expression. We are specifically targeting one BET family member, Brd2. We plan to create novel derivatives of a BET inhibitor tool compound that will selectively inhibit Brd2.
